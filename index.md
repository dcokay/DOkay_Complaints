About:

The following analysis is taken from the 2020 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaints from March-December. The following are the clearest most identifiable trends that the public ought to know about.

These analyses range from the most common type of complaint, top company offenders, and where these complaints most frequently happen.

Each takeaway from the data is neatly summarized in three histograms -- as well as a couple tables to better visualize these trends. I hope you find the information useful.
